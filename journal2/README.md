The image above is of my television remote. I own a Vizio Smart Tv, which comes with a universal remote, programmable to anything. This, consequently can be made into an extremely complicated and confusing design, however that is not the case here. This remote actually displays extremely good **Affordances**. Affordances are aspects of a design that allows the user to naturally know how to use it. Vizio accomplishes this extremely well, largely through the useage of conventions. The basic and always used arrowkeys, cas well as the conventions of the play and pause button, make for an extremely intuituve design. These conventions have become so ingrained to us that at this point, things that use them have high affordances. This is a smart tv as well, however, so there is app functionality involved as well. 

This remote also hits nearly every usability goal in the list. As far as how **Satisfying** it is, it is extremely satisfying. Satisfaction is how much you like using it. Based on my expierience, this remote is extremely satisfying to use. When using this remote, my goal typically is to watch Netflix. Well, my interaction in that regard is incredibly simple, as there is a Netflix button at the very top of the remote. They took the most popular streaming services and placed immediate interaction buttons to get to them at the very top of the interface. The outcome is immediate access to netflix and the shows I want, I could not ask for more. 

A consequence of the affordances that are included in the design is this remote has high levels of **learnability and memorability**. Learnability is how easy it is to figure out how to use something, while memorability is the ability to recall how to use it in the future. These two are perfect in this design, because the remote does not try to be anything new, it perfectly simply encapsulates conventions to make a perfectly balanced and simple design while retaining functionality. All in all, this remote is the perfect example of how to easily design a functional remote while keeping it simple.
