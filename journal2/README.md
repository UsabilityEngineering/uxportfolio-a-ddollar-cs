The image above is of my television remote. I own a Vizio Smart Tv, which comes with a universal remote, programmable to anything. This, consequently can be made into an extremely complicated and confusing design, however that is not the case here. This remote actually displays extremely good **Affordances**. Affordances are aspects of a design that allows the user to naturally know how to use it. Vizio accomplishes this extremely well, largely through the useage of conventions. The basic and always used arrowkeys, cas wel las the conventions of the play and pause button, make for an extremely intuituve design. This is a smart tv as well, however, so there is app functionality involved as well.
