This image is a pictue of the mapping of some keys on my keyboard. When I first purchased this laptop, I had no idea what those keys backlit in red did. This computer is apart of DELL's performance and gaming division of products called Alienware. Originally, my goal was to just simply use the computer to its best effectiveness, which presumably incudes the usage of these keys. The only problem, however, is that the computer itself did not come with so much as a manual. Due to this, the **learnability**, which is, the speed of which a user can grasp how to use the product, of these keys became nearly impossible. I had to dig through both the internet as well as the help section of the control center of my computer's settings to learn what these keys do. It turns out, these keys are blank slates, mappable to be read as any other key or even as a mouseclick. After finally learning what these keys do, I am now able to provide a complete analysis of this aspect of my computer. 

As far as the **safety**, or the possibility to cause harm, these keys are rather mid range. By that, what I mean is that while they can cause no actual physical harm, a user who does not know what they are doing could map the keys accidentally to something that if used in the improper time, can really mess up your computer. That leads us into **Error tolerance**, which is the ability to overcome any possible user errors. This goes hand in hand with the safety in that there is not really a clear definition of what the keys represent once they are mapped. Aside from having a unique backlight color for any given preset, there is nothing preventing you from pressing the wrong they accidentally, especially since it lets you map the same color to multiple presets. **Memorability**, which is the ability to remember the functionality of an object. Memorability is another aspect of this layout that can be kind of rough. Unless it is used incredibly often, there is virtually no real memorability to what keys are mapped where. There are however, some positives to these added keys, as they pretty much meet the rest of the usability goals fairly well. 

The actual **mapping** that is, the physical placement of the keys themselves is actually really good, it allows easy access to a specific set of keys using your left hand while presumably using the mouse with your right. Due to this expert mapping, these keys become incredibly **useful**. Usefulness is a measure of if the item actually has functionality, and they have great functionality, as it alows the user to use up to any five keys without moving around thewhole keyboard. This fact, not only makes it useful, but also incredibly **efficient**, which is a measure of how ell it does its job, and it does it well. If used right it could increase productivity exponentially. As for **effectiveness**, which is if it actually does its job, and it is really effective at its job. It does what it is supposed to, and quite well. The product is really quite **satisfying** as well, meaning is it actually pleasant to use. All in all, even though it is incredibly difficult to learn, especially initially, once you figure out what these keys are, it hits a good portion of the usability goals, and results in a smooth, satisfying expierience.
