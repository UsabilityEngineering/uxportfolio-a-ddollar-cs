This image is of an older audio/video hub for a home entertainment system, still being used in my house. This system comes with an attached surround sound system, with 5 speakers as well as a subwoofer. Originally this belonged to my grandparents, but it now lies in my house, with the surround soound still working. There is a drawback with this system being so old, however, as it lacks a remote. This is not a direct problem, as it is compatible with multiple universal remotes, however, universal remotes lack all the functionality of the system. This is cause fro much confusion and concern, a rather large **usefulness** concern, as in a rather large system, the lack of a remote can be quite complicating. 

Despite having to actually do the old school way and get up in order to use this product, the interface, despite its outdated components, actually still holds up today. Originaly, this system was intented to keep all inputs in one place. You plug in your cable box, dvd player, music player, radio antenna, as well as any other auxillary components to the television. This makes a relatively small and easy **Task analysis**, or step by step instruction for using a product. The reason this is so easy is that the system makes it a simple interaction, with each button changing the A/V ouput on the TV. Overall, this design for intended use is really simple and intuitive, despite its lack of a remote. 

However, the useage of this device is not the same as it used to be. There are no longer the RYW inputs for televisions for the most part, which slightly complicates thngs. Everything today uses HDMI cables.
