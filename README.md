Hi my name is Austin Dollar, I am a Computer Science Major, this is my second semester here at Chico State, having transferred here from Sierra College in Rocklin, California. I love the outdooer, be it hiking with my girlfriend, or Fishing Lake Oroville with my dad. I am really interested in UX as I love the Internetof Things concept, and because of how new the technology is, it is not very intuitive and I would love to improve on that. I look forward to a great semester!!
